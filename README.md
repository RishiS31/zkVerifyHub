# zkVerifyHub: A Zero-Knowledge Proof dApp on Arbitrum

## Overview

zkVerifyHub is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Arbitrum network, leveraging zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs) for secure and private verification. This project enables users to connect their wallets (e.g., MetaMask), submit zk-SNARK proofs, and receive real-time verification results through a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Wallet Integration**: Connect to wallets like MetaMask for seamless user interaction.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proof Verification**: Submit zk-SNARK proofs for validation via smart contracts.
- **Efficient Proof Processing**: Leverages zkVerify for cost-effective and modular proof verification.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Displays real-time proof verification status to users.
